# Hikma Health Mobile Application
The Hikma Health platform is a mobile electronic health record system designed for organizations working in low-resource settings to collect and access patient health information. The repository contains the mobile application (Android tested, iOS support can be includes) that supports offline functionality, thousands of patients and multiple languages including Arabic, Spanish, and English. Other languages can be added trivially.

The platform is designed to be intuitive and allow for efficient patient workflows for patient registration, data entry, and data download. You can see a user demo here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ssBdEPShWCu3ZXNCXnoodbwWgqlTncJb/view?usp=drive_link

This repository contains the client-side code for Hikma Health's mobile application. The corresponding server-side code is located at https://github.com/hikmahealth/hikma-health-backend. Please feel free to file feature requests and bugs at either location.

This app is built using React Native and can be compiled for either iOS or Android, although we do most of our testing on Android.

## FAQ

#### How do I delete the local data during testing?

Simply clear the application data and the app stored data will be removed. You can do this by going to the app settings (for android you can long press the icon from your apps menu), and choosing to clear all data from storage.

Remember that all data that is deleted before being synchronized is lost forever and this should only be done with testing data.

Furthermore, if the data has been synchronized and uploaded to the server, deleting the data locally will not help much since the data from the server will just synchronize back in on the next sync event (should be when you log in next time)

#### How do I add a new language to the app

In the application code, locate the folder `i18n`. This folder contains all the translation files, with English, Espanol and Arabic already there.

You can add new language by creating a new file with your translations and updating the `src/i18n/index.ts` file with the location and name of your new translation. Thats it!

(If you are old enough to remember the nightmare of translations just 10 years ago, its a new world!)


#### How do I get help?

If you are stuck for more than 10 minutes, please open an issue or email our head of development at `ally[at]hikmahealth.org` with your questions and concerns.

We are constantly looking for ways to build THE best portable electronic health record system and are constantly looking for feedback.

## Roadmap
Features on the roadmap represent the vision for the mobile app over the coming versions, but none are guaranteed. If there is a feature you would love to see supported, open a feature-request / issue with more details and we can prioritize features with the most requests.

- [ ]  Improve online only support (for areas with guaranteed internet access)
- [ ]  Improve test coverage (priority)
- [ ]  Faster boot time on lower end devices
- [ ]  Official iOS support
- [ ]  Memory & performance profiling
- [ ]  Improved LTR to RTL (and vice versa) support: Currently needs a screen to be re-rendered for the system to pick up the change
- [ ]  Automated CI pipeline for tests
