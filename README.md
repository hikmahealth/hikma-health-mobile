# Hikma Health Mobile Application

The Hikma Health platform is a mobile electronic health record system designed for organizations working in low-resource settings to collect and access patient health information. The repository contains the mobile application (Android tested, iOS support can be includes) that supports offline functionality, thousands of patients and multiple languages including Arabic, Spanish, and English. Other languages can be added trivially.

The platform is designed to be intuitive and allow for efficient patient workflows for patient registration, data entry, and data download. You can see a user demo here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ssBdEPShWCu3ZXNCXnoodbwWgqlTncJb/view?usp=drive_link

This repository contains the client-side code for Hikma Health's mobile application. The corresponding server-side code is located at https://github.com/hikmahealth/hikma-health-backend. Please feel free to file feature requests and bugs at either location.

This app is built using React Native and can be compiled for either iOS or Android, although we do most of our testing on Android.

## Quick Start

First, make sure you have set up react-native to run on your local environment by following the latest documentation on the official guide found here: https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup

Clone this project

```bash
  git clone git@github.com:hikmahealth/hikma-health-mobile.git
```

Set up the backend either locally or remotely by following the instructions on the backend repository: https://github.com/hikmahealth/hikma-health-backend

Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd hikma-health-mobile
```

Install the dependencies - depending on your internet connection, this could take a few minutes.

```bash
  npm install
```

Run the application on mobile application on a connected device and/or emulator

```bash
  npm run android
```

## Environment Variables

To run this project, you will need to add the following environment variable to yours .env file

1. `HIKMA_API`: This is the endpoint for where your backend is hosted. This file is by default already ignored in the `.gitignore` file, make sure it remains there.
2. `SENTRY_DNS`: (Optional) If you are using Sentry for error reporting, add your DNS endpoint here
3. `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN`: (Optional) If you are using Sentry for error reporting, add your auth token here

The Hikma Health App project's structure will look similar to this:

```

### ./app directory

Included in an Ignite boilerplate project is the `app` directory. This is a directory you would normally have to create when using vanilla React Native.

The inside of the `app` directory looks similar to the following:

```
app
â”œâ”€â”€ components
â”œâ”€â”€ config
â”œâ”€â”€ i18n
â”œâ”€â”€ models
â”œâ”€â”€ navigators
â”œâ”€â”€ screens
â”œâ”€â”€ services
â”œâ”€â”€ theme
â”œâ”€â”€ utils
â””â”€â”€ app.tsx
```

**components**
This is where our reusable components live which help you build your screens.

**i18n**
This is where our translations will live if you are using `react-native-i18n`.

**models**
This is where our app's models will live. Each model has a directory which will contain the `mobx-state-tree` model file, test file, and any other supporting files like actions, types, etc.

**navigators**
This is where our `react-navigation` navigators will live.

**screens**
This is where our screen components will live. A screen is a React component which will take up the entire screen and be part of the navigation hierarchy. Each screen will have a directory containing the `.tsx` file, along with any assets or other helper files.

**services**
Any services that interface with the outside world will live here (think REST APIs, Push Notifications, etc.).

**theme**
Here lives the theme for your application, including spacing, colors, and typography.

**utils**
This is a great place to put miscellaneous helpers and utilities. Things like date helpers, formatters, etc. are often found here. However, it should only be used for things that are truly shared across your application. If a helper or utility is only used by a specific component or model, consider co-locating your helper with that component or model.

**app.tsx** This is the entry point to your app. This is where you will find the main App component which renders the rest of the application.

### ./ignite directory

The `ignite` directory stores all things Ignite, including CLI and boilerplate items. Here you will find templates you can customize to help you get started with React Native.

### ./test directory

This directory will hold your Jest configs and mocks.

## FAQ

#### How do I delete the local data during testing?

Simply clear the application data and the app stored data will be removed. You can do this by going to the app settings (for android you can long press the icon from your apps menu), and choosing to clear all data from storage.

Remember that all data that is deleted before being synchronized is lost forever and this should only be done with testing data.

Furthermore, if the data has been synchronized and uploaded to the server, deleting the data locally will not help much since the data from the server will just synchronize back in on the next sync event (should be when you log in next time)

#### How do I add a new language to the app

In the application code, locate the folder `i18n`. This folder contains all the translation files, with English, Espanol and Arabic already there.

You can add new language by creating a new file with your translations and updating the `src/i18n/index.ts` file with the location and name of your new translation. Thats it!

(If you are old enough to remember the nightmare of translations just 10 years ago, its a new world!)

#### How do I get help?

If you are stuck for more than 10 minutes, please open an issue or email our head of development at `ally[at]hikmahealth.org` with your questions and concerns.

We are constantly looking for ways to build THE best portable electronic health record system and are constantly looking for feedback.

## Roadmap

Features on the roadmap represent the vision for the mobile app over the coming versions, but none are guaranteed. If there is a feature you would love to see supported, open a feature-request / issue with more details and we can prioritize features with the most requests.

- [ ] Improve online only support (for areas with guaranteed internet access)
- [ ] Improve test coverage (priority to 80%)
- [ ] Faster boot time on lower end devices
- [x] Official iOS support (add documentation for this support)
- [ ] Memory & performance profiling
- [ ] Automated CI pipeline for tests (add coveralls)

## Credits

This project, like many other open source works, relies heavily on the open source community and their contributions. We have built this EHR system on the shoulders of great projects such as the [Ignite](https://github.com/infinitered/ignite) boilerplate, WatermelonDB, and many others.
