# Contributing to Hikma Health Mobile Application

We appreciate your interest in contributing to the Hikma Health Mobile Application project. This document outlines our contribution process and guidelines.

## Development Workflow

We use a version of trunk-based development where the `dev` branch serves as our trunk. Here's an overview of our process:

1. All development work is done on feature branches created from the `dev` branch.
2. Pull requests are made against the `dev` branch, not the `main` branch.
3. Tests are run on the `dev` branch.
4. If tests pass, code is merged into the `dev` branch.
5. Periodically, after thorough testing, `dev` is merged into `main` for release.

## Pull Request Guidelines

- Always create pull requests against the `dev` branch.
- Ensure your code follows our style guide and passes all tests.
- Include a clear description of the changes and their purpose.
- Link any relevant issues in your pull request description.

## Code Review Process

1. Submit your pull request against the `dev` branch.
2. Wait for review from the maintainers.
3. Address any feedback or comments.
4. Once approved, your code will be merged into `dev`.
